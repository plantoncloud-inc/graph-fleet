# GitHub Branch Protection Setup for Graph Fleet

**Date**: October 30, 2025

## Summary

Implemented GitHub branch protection configuration for the Graph Fleet repository to enforce code quality gates before merging pull requests. The solution includes an automated setup script using GitHub CLI, comprehensive documentation, and README updates to guide developers and administrators through the branch protection process.

## Problem Statement

After adding the "Validate Python Code" workflow to automatically run Ruff linting and MyPy type checking on pull requests, it was discovered that PRs could still be merged even when validation checks failed. The workflow provided visibility into code quality issues but had no enforcement mechanism to prevent broken code from reaching the main branch.

### Pain Points

- Pull requests could be merged regardless of validation workflow status
- No systematic enforcement of code quality standards at merge time
- Risk of deploying code with linting errors or type issues to LangGraph Cloud
- Lack of documentation on how to configure repository protection rules

## Solution

Implemented a complete branch protection solution with three components:

1. **Automated Setup Script**: Shell script using GitHub CLI to apply branch protection rules programmatically
2. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed guide covering setup, verification, and troubleshooting
3. **README Integration**: Updated project documentation to explain the enforcement mechanism

The solution requires the "Lint and Type Check" workflow (defined in `.github/workflows/validate.yml`) to pass successfully before any PR can be merged to the `main` branch.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Branch Protection Setup Script

Created `.github/scripts/setup-branch-protection.sh` that:

- Uses GitHub CLI (`gh`) to configure branch protection via API
- Requires the "Lint and Type Check" status check to pass
- Enforces branches to be up-to-date before merging
- Includes pre-flight checks for GitHub CLI installation and authentication
- Provides clear user confirmation prompts
- Shows helpful error messages with troubleshooting guidance

**Key Configuration Applied**:
```bash
gh api --method PUT "/repos/plantoncloud-inc/graph-fleet/branches/main/protection" \
  -f required_status_checks[strict]=true \
  -f "required_status_checks[contexts][]=$STATUS_CHECK" \
  -f enforce_admins=false \
  -f allow_force_pushes=false
```

The script is idempotent and can be re-run to update settings.

### 2. Documentation

Created `.github/BRANCH_PROTECTION.md` with:

**Setup Options**:
- Automated setup using the script (for CLI users with admin access)
- Manual setup via GitHub UI (step-by-step screenshots alternative)

**Verification Procedures**:
- How to test branch protection with a failing PR
- How to verify the merge button is correctly disabled
- What success looks like when validation passes

**Troubleshooting Guide**:
- Status check not appearing in settings → workflow hasn't run yet
- PRs still mergeable despite failures → protection rules not configured
- Branch not up-to-date → need to merge/rebase
- Permission errors → requires admin access
- GitHub CLI authentication issues → re-authentication steps

**Technical Reference**:
- Workflow file structure and job naming
- Why the job name must match exactly in protection settings
- How to bypass protection (admins only, discouraged)
- Links to GitHub's official documentation

### 3. README Updates

Updated the "Code Quality and Validation" section in `README.md`:

- Added "Branch Protection" subsection explaining enforcement
- Clarified that PRs cannot be merged when validation fails
- Linked to the detailed branch protection documentation
- Reinforced the connection between local `make build` and CI validation

## Benefits

### Code Quality Enforcement
- **Guaranteed quality**: All merged code passes linting and type checking
- **No manual oversight needed**: Automated enforcement removes human error
- **Consistent standards**: Same validation rules apply to all contributors

### Developer Experience
- **Clear feedback**: Developers know immediately if their PR can't be merged
- **Self-service resolution**: Failed checks show exactly what needs fixing
- **Local validation alignment**: `make build` runs the same checks as CI

### Operations
- **Reduced deployment risk**: LangGraph Cloud only receives validated code
- **Audit trail**: GitHub provides history of protection rule changes
- **Configurable enforcement**: Can adjust rules as requirements evolve

### Documentation
- **Complete setup guide**: Both automated and manual approaches documented
- **Troubleshooting coverage**: Common issues anticipated and solutions provided
- **Maintainability**: Future team members can understand and modify the setup

## Impact

### Immediate
- PRs targeting `main` now require successful validation before merge
- Protection can be applied by running the script with admin credentials
- All contributors have clear documentation on the enforcement policy

### Long-term
- Establishes code quality as a non-negotiable requirement
- Reduces time spent debugging issues caused by linting/type errors
- Creates a pattern that can be replicated across other repositories

## Usage

**For Repository Admins** (to enable protection):
```bash
cd /path/to/graph-fleet
./.github/scripts/setup-branch-protection.sh
```

**For Contributors** (understanding the rules):
- Read `.github/BRANCH_PROTECTION.md` for complete details
- Run `make build` locally before pushing to ensure CI will pass
- If a PR is blocked, check the workflow run for specific errors

**Verification**:
After enabling, create a test PR with a linting error to confirm the merge button is disabled until validation passes.

## Technical Details

### Files Created
- `.github/scripts/setup-branch-protection.sh` - Automation script (executable)
- `.github/BRANCH_PROTECTION.md` - Comprehensive documentation

### Files Modified
- `README.md` - Added branch protection section

### Required Status Check
- **Name**: `Lint and Type Check`
- **Source**: `.github/workflows/validate.yml`
- **Job**: `validate`

The status check name must match exactly (case-sensitive) for GitHub to recognize it.

### GitHub API Endpoint
```
PUT /repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches/{branch}/protection
```

See [GitHub Branch Protection API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/branches/branch-protection) for details.

## Known Limitations

### Repository Settings
Branch protection rules are repository settings, not code-based configuration. While the script automates application, the rules themselves live in GitHub's database, not in version control.

### Admin Bypass
Repository admins can bypass branch protection rules by default. The current configuration allows this for operational flexibility. To enforce rules on admins, update `enforce_admins=true` in the script.

### First-Run Requirement
The "Lint and Type Check" status check won't appear in GitHub's protection settings UI until the workflow has run at least once. Create a test PR to trigger the workflow initially.

### Manual Execution
The script requires manual execution - it's not automatically applied to new forks or repository clones. This is intentional to prevent unauthorized modification of repository settings.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future consideration:

- **Terraform/IaC**: Manage branch protection via Terraform for infrastructure-as-code approach
- **GitHub App**: Create an app that automatically configures protection on repository creation
- **Additional Checks**: Add more required status checks as the validation suite grows
- **Review Requirements**: Configure required code reviews from specific teams
- **CODEOWNERS**: Implement automatic reviewer assignment based on file paths
