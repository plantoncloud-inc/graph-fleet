# Summary: AWS ECS Agent Organization

## What We've Done

### 1. **Cleaned Up File Organization**

```
aws_ecs_service/
├── Core Implementation Files:
│   ├── agent.py              # The actual agent implementation
│   ├── graph.py              # LangGraph integration
│   ├── mcp_tools.py          # MCP tools integration
│   ├── credential_context.py # Credential storage
│   ├── credential_tools.py   # Credential management tools
│   ├── prompts.py            # Agent prompts
│   └── configuration.py      # Config models
│
├── demos/                    # Demonstration scripts
├── tests/                    # Test files  
└── docs/                     # Documentation
```

### 2. **Removed Confusion**

- **Deleted `agent_with_session.py`** - This was a proposed solution, not the actual implementation
- Moved all test/demo files to appropriate directories
- Kept only actual implementation files in the main directory

### 3. **Clarified the Issue**

The current `agent.py` has a **security vulnerability**:
- Uses a global singleton for credentials
- Different users share the same credentials (BAD!)
- Needs to be fixed before production use

## Current Status

### ✅ What Works
- Credential sharing between subagents within one invocation
- The overall agent architecture
- MCP tools integration

### ❌ What Doesn't Work
- Isolation between different agent invocations
- Each user gets their own isolated credentials

## How to Test

1. **Run demos to understand the issue**:
   ```bash
   cd demos/
   python3 standalone_credential_test.py
   ```

2. **See test cases**:
   ```bash
   cd tests/
   # Run with pytest when dependencies are available
   ```

## What Needs to be Done

See `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` for the exact changes needed in:
- `graph.py` - Create session context per invocation
- `agent.py` - Accept and use session context
- `credential_tools.py` - Use provided context instead of global

## Key Takeaway

The implementation is almost complete, but has a critical security issue that must be fixed before production use. The demos clearly show both the problem and the solution.
