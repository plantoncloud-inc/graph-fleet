# Implementation Status: Credential Handling

## Current State

✅ **FIXED**: The AWS ECS Deep Agent now properly implements session-based credential isolation for secure multi-tenant usage.

## The Issue (Now Fixed)

The previous implementation used a global singleton for credential storage:

```python
# In credential_context.py
def get_credential_context() -> CredentialContext:
    global _credential_context
    if _credential_context is None:
        _credential_context = CredentialContext()  # Single global instance!
    return _credential_context
```

**Previous Problems**:
- Security breach: User B could access User A's AWS credentials
- Race conditions: Concurrent invocations overwrite each other's credentials
- No isolation between different users/sessions

**Current Solution**: Each agent invocation now creates its own credential context, ensuring complete isolation.

## What Works

Within a single agent invocation, the credential sharing between subagents works correctly:
1. Service-identifier stores credentials
2. All other subagents can retrieve and use them
3. MCP tools automatically get credentials from context

## What Has Been Fixed

Each agent invocation now has its own isolated credential context. Here's what was implemented:

### In `graph.py`:

✅ **Implemented**: Creates a new credential context for each invocation:

```python
async def ecs_agent_node(state: ECSState, config: RunnableConfig | None = None) -> ECSState:
    """Node that runs the ECS Deep Agent."""
    logger.info("Processing ECS Agent node")
    
    # Create a session-specific credential context for this invocation
    session_context = CredentialContext()
    logger.info("Created session-specific credential context")
    
    # Create the agent with the session context
    model = config.get("model", "claude-3-5-haiku-20241022")
    agent = await create_ecs_deep_agent(model=model, credential_context=session_context)
    
    try:
        # Run the agent
        result = await agent.ainvoke(agent_input)
        # ... process result ...
        return updated_state
    finally:
        # Always clean up credentials after invocation
        await session_context.clear()
        logger.info("Cleared session-specific credentials")
```

### In `agent.py`:

✅ **Implemented**: Accepts and uses the credential context parameter:

```python
async def create_ecs_deep_agent(
    model: Union[str, LanguageModelLike] = "claude-3-5-haiku-20241022",
    aws_credentials: dict[str, str] | None = None,
    credential_context: Optional[CredentialContext] = None,
    **kwargs,
) -> Any:
    """Create the unified ECS Deep Agent with session isolation."""
    
    # Get all tools with the session context
    tools = await get_all_mcp_tools(aws_credentials=aws_credentials, credential_context=credential_context)
    
    # Create session-specific credential management tools if context provided
    if credential_context:
        logger.info("Using provided session-specific credential context")
        from .credential_tools import create_session_credential_tools
        session_tools = create_session_credential_tools(credential_context)
        tools.extend(session_tools)
    else:
        logger.warning("No credential context provided - using global singleton (SECURITY RISK!)")
        # Fall back to global tools for backward compatibility
        tools.extend(CREDENTIAL_MANAGEMENT_TOOLS)
```

### In `credential_tools.py`:

✅ **Implemented**: Added `create_session_credential_tools()` function that creates tools bound to a specific context:

```python
def create_session_credential_tools(credential_context):
    """Create session-specific credential management tools bound to a given context."""
    # Creates versions of all credential tools that use the provided
    # credential_context instead of the global singleton
    return [
        set_aws_credentials_context,
        get_aws_credentials_context,
        set_service_context_info,
        get_service_context_info,
        extract_and_set_credentials_from_stack_job,
        clear_credential_context,
    ]
```

## Testing

Run the following test to verify the credential isolation:
- `tests/verify_isolation.py` - Comprehensive isolation verification that tests all aspects

## Current Status

✅ **READY FOR PRODUCTION**: The credential isolation issue has been fixed. Each agent invocation now has its own isolated credential context.

## Key Benefits

1. **Security**: Complete isolation between different users' credentials
2. **Concurrency**: Multiple users can safely invoke the agent simultaneously
3. **Automatic Cleanup**: Credentials are cleared after each invocation
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Falls back to global context with a warning if needed

## How It Works Now

1. When the agent is invoked via `graph.py`, a new `CredentialContext` is created
2. This context is passed to all components (agent, tools, MCP)
3. All credential operations use this session-specific context
4. The context is cleared in a `finally` block to ensure cleanup

This ensures that even if User A and User B invoke the agent at the same time, they will have completely isolated credential contexts and cannot access each other's AWS credentials.
