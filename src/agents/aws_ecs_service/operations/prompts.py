- Look for patterns across multiple services/tasks if scope indicates broader issues

**Evidence Collection Strategy:**
- Service health: deployment status, desired vs running task counts, service events
- Task analysis: task definitions, resource allocation, health check configuration
- Infrastructure: cluster capacity, instance health, network configuration
- Application logs: error patterns, performance metrics, recent changes
- Timeline correlation: relate symptoms to recent deployments or configuration changes
