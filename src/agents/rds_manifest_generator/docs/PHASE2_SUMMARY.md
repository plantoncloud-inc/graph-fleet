# Phase 2 Implementation Summary

## ✅ Status: COMPLETE

Phase 2 of the RDS Manifest Generator has been successfully implemented and tested.

## What Changed

### Core Philosophy: AI-Driven Question Generation

**Key Decision**: Instead of creating hardcoded question templates for each proto field, we teach the AI agent how to generate questions dynamically by:

1. Querying the proto schema using existing tools
2. Combining schema information with built-in AWS knowledge
3. Generating contextual, intelligent questions on the fly
4. Validating responses conversationally (soft validation)

**Why This Matters**: This approach scales to all 30+ AWS resource types without additional code. No templates to maintain, no hardcoded logic to update.

## Files Created (3)

1. **`src/agents/rds_manifest_generator/tools/requirement_tools.py`** (new)
   - `store_requirement(field_name, value)` - Save user responses
   - `get_collected_requirements()` - View all collected data
   - `check_requirement_collected(field_name)` - Check if field is collected

2. **`test_rds_agent_phase2.py`** (new)
   - Tests for requirement storage
   - Tests for agent configuration
   - Tests for schema loader with validation rules
   - Workflow simulation demonstrating AI-driven approach

3. **`src/agents/rds_manifest_generator/PHASE2_COMPLETE.md`** (new)
   - Detailed documentation of Phase 2 implementation
   - Technical decisions and rationale
   - Testing results and verification

## Files Modified (3)

1. **`src/agents/rds_manifest_generator/agent.py`**
   - Enhanced system prompt with comprehensive workflow guidance
   - Teaches AI how to query schema, generate questions, validate responses
   - Added requirement collection tools to agent
   - Uses raw string for prompt to avoid escape sequence warnings

2. **`src/agents/rds_manifest_generator/schema/loader.py`**
   - **Bug fix**: Now handles multi-line proto field definitions
   - Collects full field text including validation annotations
   - Fixed validation rule pattern matching for multiple rules
   - Validation rules now show up correctly in tool output

3. **`src/agents/rds_manifest_generator/README.md`**
   - Updated feature list to show Phase 2 completion
   - Added AI-driven question generation as key feature

## How It Works

### Example Conversation Flow

**User**: "I want to create a production Postgres database"

**Agent**:
1. Uses `write_todos` to create visible plan:
   ```
   1. Database configuration ⏳
   2. Instance sizing ⏳
   3. Credentials ⏳
   4. Optional features ⏳
   ```

2. Uses `get_rds_field_info('engine_version')` to understand field

3. Generates intelligent question:
   > "You mentioned Postgres - what version would you like? For production, I'd recommend 14.10 or 15.5."

4. User responds: "15.5"

5. Agent validates (version is string, min_len > 0), stores using `store_requirement('engine_version', '15.5')`

6. Updates todo: `1. Database configuration ✓`

7. Continues with next questions...

### Soft Validation Example

**User provides**: "t3.micro" (for instance_class)

**Agent**:
1. Queries field info, sees validation: `pattern: ^db\.`
2. Checks user input against pattern
3. Responds conversationally:
   > "Instance class needs to start with 'db.' - did you mean db.t3.micro?"

**User**: "yes, db.t3.micro"

**Agent**:
1. Validates again (now matches)
2. Stores: `store_requirement('instance_class', 'db.t3.micro')`
3. Continues

## Testing

All tests pass:

```bash
poetry run python test_rds_agent_phase2.py
```

Output:
```
=== Phase 2 Tests ===
✓ Requirement storage works
✓ Agent configuration works
✓ Schema loader works for AI queries
✓ Phase 2 workflow simulation complete

=== All Phase 2 Tests Passed ===

Key Phase 2 Features:
  ✓ Requirement storage tools for tracking user responses
  ✓ Agent configured with requirement + schema tools
  ✓ Schema loader provides field info for AI to query
  ✓ AI generates questions dynamically (no hardcoded templates)
  ✓ AI validates conversationally using proto validation rules
```

## Ready to Test

Start LangGraph Studio:

```bash
cd /Users/suresh/scm/github.com/plantoncloud-inc/graph-fleet
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key-here"
make run
```

Open http://localhost:8123 and try:
- "I want to create a production Postgres database"
- "Help me set up a MySQL RDS instance for development"
- "I need a high-availability database"

The agent will:
- Create a todo plan
- Ask intelligent questions with context
- Validate responses conversationally
- Track progress
- Store requirements

## Next: Phase 3

Phase 3 will implement YAML manifest generation:
- Build manifest from collected requirements
- Map field names (snake_case → camelCase)
- Generate metadata structure
- Format YAML properly
- Validate final manifest

**Phase 2 Complete**: ✅  
**Time**: ~3 hours  
**Tests**: All passing  
**Agent**: Ready for interactive testing
