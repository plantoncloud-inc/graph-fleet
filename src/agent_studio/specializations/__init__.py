"""Agent Specializations Module

This module contains predefined specialization profiles that can be applied to any
base cloud agent to customize their behavior for specific use cases.

Specializations include:
- Cost Optimizer: Focus on cost analysis and optimization
- Security Auditor: Security assessment and compliance
- Troubleshooter: Problem diagnosis and resolution
- Architect: Solution design and architecture planning

Each specialization defines custom instructions, sub-agent configurations,
and tool preferences that modify the base agent's behavior.
