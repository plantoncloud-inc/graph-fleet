"""Multi-Cloud MCP Integration Module

This module extends the MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration patterns
established in the AWS agent to support multiple cloud providers.

It provides cloud-specific MCP configurations and client management for:
- AWS (extending existing implementation)
- GCP (Google Cloud Platform)
- Azure (Microsoft Azure)

Each cloud provider integration maintains the unified MCP client management
approach while handling provider-specific credential management and API tools.
