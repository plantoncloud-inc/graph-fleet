"""Agent Templates Module

This module contains cloud-specific agent templates that extend the base agent
architecture to support multiple cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure).

Each template follows the established two-node architecture pattern:
- Node A: Credential selection and management
- Node B: Cloud-specific operations with DeepAgent capabilities

Templates are designed to be configurable and extensible through the
Agent Studio platform.
