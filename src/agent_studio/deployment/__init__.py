"""Agent Deployment and Lifecycle Management Module

This module provides agent lifecycle management capabilities including:
- Deployment to LangGraph Studio
- Version control and rollback
- Monitoring and health checks
- Configuration management across environments

It extends the existing `langgraph.json` pattern to support multiple agent
variants and their specific configurations.
