"""Agent Studio Deployment and Lifecycle Management Module

This module provides comprehensive deployment and lifecycle management capabilities
for Agent Studio agents, including:

- Deployment to LangGraph Studio with multi-agent support
- Version control and configuration management
- Monitoring and health checks
- Rollback and recovery mechanisms
- Environment-specific deployments (dev, staging, production)

The deployment system extends the existing `langgraph.json` pattern to support
multiple agent variants and their specific configurations while maintaining
compatibility with LangGraph Studio deployment requirements.
