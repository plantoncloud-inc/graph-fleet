- [Project README](./README.md)

## Day 1 Completed ✅
1. ✅ Created agent structure extending `DeepAgentState`
2. ✅ Implemented core agent with Deep Agents framework
3. ✅ Built tool wrappers for context, diagnostics, and remediation
4. ✅ Set up sub-agents for specialized tasks
5. ✅ Fixed import paths for Planton Cloud MCP tools

## Day 2 Completed ✅
1. ✅ Integrated actual AWS MCP tools (awslabs.ecs-mcp-server)
2. ✅ Enhanced context gathering with more Planton Cloud queries
3. ✅ Added comprehensive error handling
4. ✅ Created test suite with 5/5 tests passing
5. ✅ Fixed MCP server configuration and sub-agent definitions
6. ✅ Verified agent creation, context gathering, diagnostics, and graph integration

## Day 3 Completed ✅
1. ✅ Added 5 sophisticated diagnostic patterns (task failures, deployments, resources, networking, health checks)
2. ✅ Implemented 3 intelligent remediation scenarios (memory exhaustion, deployment recovery, auto-scaling)
3. ✅ Created safety checks and risk assessment system
4. ✅ Built integrated analyze_and_remediate tool
5. ✅ Added comprehensive test suite for enhanced features
6. ✅ Created detailed documentation for all new features

## Next Steps (Future)
1. Add predictive failure detection using historical data
2. Implement cost optimization recommendations
3. Create custom remediation scenario framework
4. Add integration with CloudWatch Insights
5. Build multi-service dependency analysis

## Key Architecture Decisions Made
- ✅ Using existing `DeepAgentState` (no reinventing)
- ✅ File-based state management for transparency
- ✅ Three sub-agents for specialization
- ✅ Interrupt-based approval for remediation
- ✅ Pattern-based diagnostic engine
- ✅ Scenario-based remediation with safety checks

## Key Features Implemented
- **5 Diagnostic Patterns**: Comprehensive issue detection
- **3 Remediation Scenarios**: Automated healing with safety
- **Risk Assessment**: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL levels
- **Approval System**: User control over changes
- **Executive Summaries**: Human-readable status reports
- **Integrated Workflow**: Seamless diagnostic to remediation flow
