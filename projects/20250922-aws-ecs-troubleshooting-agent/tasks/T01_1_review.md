# Task T01: Review Feedback

**Review Date**: September 22, 2025  
**Reviewer**: Suresh  
**Original Plan**: T01_0_plan.md

## Feedback Summary

### 1. State Management Architecture
**Issue**: Too many state variables (`service_context`, `aws_credentials`, `diagnostics`, `remediation_plan`, `execution_results`)

**Recommendation**: Adopt Deep Agents pattern:
- Use file system for passing information between stages
- Minimize state variables to just `messages` and `todos` (planning items)
- This aligns with the planning → review → implementation stages we discussed

**Reference**: [LangChain Deep Agents](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents) demonstrates this pattern effectively

### 2. Workflow State Design
**Issue**: Current design uses `user_input` as a simple string

**Recommendation**: Follow Deep Agents pattern:
- Use `messages` (conversation history)
- Use `todos` for planning/task tracking
- This better supports autonomous operation with built-in planning

### 3. Code Removal Task
**Issue**: Plan includes removing existing `/src/agents/aws_ecs_service/` code

**Decision**: Do NOT remove existing code
- Keep existing code as-is
- New agent has different name: `aws-ecs-troubleshooting-agent`
- Manual cleanup will be handled separately
- Remove all references to code deletion from project documentation

## Key Architectural Changes Needed

1. **Adopt Deep Agents Framework**:
   - Leverage `deepagents` package patterns
   - Use planning tool (`write_todos`) for task management
   - Use virtual file system for context passing
   - Implement sub-agents for specialized tasks

2. **Simplify State Management**:
   - Primary state: `messages` and `files`
   - Use files to store:
     - `context.json` - Planton Cloud context
     - `aws_config.json` - AWS credentials and config
     - `diagnostics.json` - Diagnostic results
     - `remediation_plan.json` - Fix proposals
     - `execution_log.json` - Action results

3. **Planning-First Approach**:
   - Agent creates todos before acting
   - Clear task breakdown for transparency
   - Autonomous execution of planned tasks

## Benefits of Deep Agents Approach

1. **Context Quarantine**: Sub-agents handle specific tasks without polluting main context
2. **Better Planning**: Built-in todo system for structured execution
3. **Cleaner State**: File system abstraction reduces state complexity
4. **Proven Pattern**: Based on successful implementations like Claude Code

## Action Items for Revised Plan

- [ ] Redesign using Deep Agents architecture
- [ ] Implement file-based state management
- [ ] Create sub-agents for specialized tasks
- [ ] Remove all references to code deletion
- [ ] Add planning tool integration
- [ ] Update workflow to use messages + files pattern

## Next Steps
Create T01_2_revised_plan.md incorporating:
1. Deep Agents framework integration
2. File system state management
3. Planning tool (todos) for autonomous operation
4. No code removal tasks
5. Sub-agents for context isolation
