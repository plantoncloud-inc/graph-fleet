# Project: Remediation DeepAgent Conversion

## Overview
- **Start Date**: Tuesday, September 23, 2025
- **Timeline**: 1 week
- **Type**: Refactoring
- **Status**: Active

## Description
Convert AWS ECS troubleshooter's remediation sub-agent from monolithic tool approach to DeepAgent patterns with LLM-driven tool selection

## Primary Goal
Refactor remediation sub-agent to align with DeepAgent patterns used in context gathering and diagnostic phases, implementing proper tool decomposition and approval workflows

## Technology Stack
- Python/LangGraph
- DeepAgents framework
- AWS MCP tools

## Affected Components
- AWS ECS troubleshooter remediation sub-agent
- Remediation tools
- Remediation scenarios

## Dependencies
- DeepAgent patterns from context gathering and diagnostic sub-agents
- AWS MCP server tools for executing fixes
- Existing remediation scenarios logic

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Remediation sub-agent uses DeepAgent patterns with proper instructions
- [ ] Monolithic remediation tool decomposed into LLM-selectable individual tools
- [ ] All remediation actions require explicit approval
- [ ] File-based state management for remediation plans and results
- [ ] Integration with existing context and diagnostic outputs

## Risks
- Breaking existing remediation functionality
- Ensuring all remediation actions maintain approval requirements
- Proper error handling and rollback mechanisms

## Special Requirements
- All remediation actions must have approval interrupts
- Follow DeepAgent patterns for instructions and tool design
- Maintain safety-first approach from existing implementation
