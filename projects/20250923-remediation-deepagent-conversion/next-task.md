## Current Status
- Project initialized: Tuesday, September 23, 2025
- Current phase: Implementation Complete
- Status: Ready for testing

## Quick Links
- [Project README](./README.md)
- [Current Task Plan](./tasks/T01_0_plan.md)
- [Task Directory](./tasks/)

## Context Files
Key files to reference:
- `/src/agents/aws_ecs_troubleshooter/agent.py` - Main agent with sub-agents
- `/src/agents/aws_ecs_troubleshooter/instructions.py` - Current instructions
- `/src/agents/aws_ecs_troubleshooter/tools/remediation_tools.py` - Current remediation tools
- `/src/agents/aws_ecs_troubleshooter/tools/remediation_scenarios.py` - Remediation engine

## What Was Completed
1. Created DeepAgent-style instructions for remediation specialist
2. Updated agent configuration to use MCP tools directly
3. Removed old custom remediation tools
4. Maintained approval requirements for all remediation actions

## Key Changes
- **Remediation Instructions**: Clear workflow for reading diagnosis and using MCP tools
- **Agent Configuration**: Simplified to use AWS MCP tools directly
- **No Custom Tools**: Removed `execute_ecs_fix` and `analyze_and_remediate`
- **Direct MCP Usage**: Maps issues directly to MCP tools like `ecs_resource_management`

## Testing the Implementation
The remediation specialist will:
1. Use `ls` to find diagnosis files
2. Read diagnosis to understand issues
3. Create remediation plans
4. Execute fixes using AWS MCP tools (with approval)
5. Log all actions for audit

## Next Actions
- Test the remediation workflow end-to-end
- Verify MCP tools are called correctly
- Ensure approval interrupts work as expected
