# Task T01: Execution - Remediation DeepAgent Conversion

**Started**: Tuesday, September 23, 2025  
**Status**: IN PROGRESS  
**Approach**: Simple implementation using MCP tools directly

## Execution Summary

Based on feedback to keep it simple, I've implemented:

### Phase 1: Remediation Instructions ✅

Created comprehensive DeepAgent-style instructions in `instructions.py`:
- Clear workflow for reading diagnosis files
- Direct mapping of issues to AWS MCP tools
- No custom tool creation - uses MCP tools directly
- Approval required for all remediation actions

Key features of the instructions:
1. **File Discovery**: Uses `ls` to find diagnosis files
2. **Issue Mapping**: Clear mapping of issues to MCP tools
   - Insufficient tasks → `ecs_resource_management`
   - Stuck deployment → `update_ecs_service`
   - Unhealthy tasks → `stop_task`
3. **Safety First**: All actions require approval
4. **Documentation**: Creates remediation plans and execution logs

### Phase 2: Agent Configuration ✅

Updated `agent.py` to configure the remediation sub-agent:
- Removed old custom remediation tools (`execute_ecs_fix`, `analyze_and_remediate`)
- Configured sub-agent to use MCP tools directly
- Added proper tool list (mainly think_tool, MCP tools are auto-discovered)
- Updated imports to remove unused tools

### Phase 3: Interrupt Configuration ✅

The existing interrupt configuration already handles MCP tools:
- Any MCP tool with update/create/delete/stop/restart requires approval
- This covers all remediation actions automatically
- No additional configuration needed

## Key Simplifications Made

1. **No Custom Tools**: Removed all custom remediation tool wrappers
2. **Direct MCP Usage**: Remediation specialist uses AWS MCP tools directly
3. **Simple Workflow**: Read diagnosis → Plan → Execute with MCP tools
4. **Minimal Code**: Only updated instructions and agent configuration

## Files Modified

1. `/src/agents/aws_ecs_troubleshooter/instructions.py`:
   - Added comprehensive remediation specialist instructions
   - Updated main agent description of remediation

2. `/src/agents/aws_ecs_troubleshooter/agent.py`:
   - Removed old remediation tool imports
   - Updated remediation sub-agent configuration
   - Removed custom remediation tools from tool list

## Testing Approach

The remediation specialist will:
1. Use `ls` to find files like `diagnosis_summary_*.md`
2. Read the diagnosis to understand issues
3. Create a remediation plan
4. Use appropriate MCP tool with approval
5. Log the execution results

## Next Steps

The implementation is complete and follows the simplified approach:
- ✅ Uses AWS MCP tools directly
- ✅ No unnecessary custom tools
- ✅ Clear workflow from diagnosis to remediation
- ✅ Maintains safety with approval requirements

The remediation sub-agent is now ready to:
- Read diagnosis files from the virtual filesystem
- Execute fixes using AWS MCP tools
- Document all actions for audit trail
