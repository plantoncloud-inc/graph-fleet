# Task T01: Developer Review Feedback

**Date**: Tuesday, September 23, 2025  
**Reviewer**: User  
**Status**: Feedback Captured

## Key Feedback Points

### 1. **KEEP IT SIMPLE**
- Primary goal: Establish the framework for building agents
- OK to lose some features for simplicity
- Focus on understanding and establishing the pattern
- Add features incrementally later

### 2. **Tool Architecture Simplification**
- Don't create separate tools unless absolutely necessary
- Use AWS MCP tools directly whenever possible
- Only wrap MCP tools when customization is required
- Avoid defining new tools if MCP already provides them

### 3. **Missing Workflow Integration**
- Need clear communication flow: Context → Diagnosis → Remediation
- Remediation sub-agent must read diagnosis output
- Show how diagnosis findings are passed to remediation
- Establish clear dependencies between phases

### 4. **Reduce Functionality**
- Current plan is too complicated
- Remove advanced features for now
- Focus on basic remediation capabilities
- Simplify the implementation significantly

## Specific Changes Requested

1. **Remove unnecessary tool creation** - Use MCP tools directly
2. **Add workflow integration** - Show how diagnosis → remediation works
3. **Simplify scope** - Remove advanced remediation scenarios
4. **Focus on pattern** - Establish DeepAgent pattern first, features later

## Next Action
Create a simplified revised plan (T01_2_revised_plan.md) that addresses these concerns.
