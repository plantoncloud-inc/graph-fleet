## Project Status

ðŸŽ‰ **PROJECT COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

All tasks have been completed:
- âœ… Created credential loader utility 
- âœ… Refactored all 3 duplicate code blocks
- âœ… Validated implementation
- âœ… Documentation updated

## Implementation Summary

**Achieved:**
- **94 lines of duplicated code** reduced to **3 clean utility calls**
- Single source of truth for credential loading
- Improved maintainability and consistency
- No functional changes - identical behavior preserved

## Next Steps

Project is complete! The credential extraction logic has been successfully modularized.

## Project Context

**Objective:** Modularize duplicated AWS credential extraction logic from `credentials.json`

**Current Duplication:** 3 identical code blocks in `diagnostic_wrappers.py`:
- Line 91-124: `describe_ecs_services_wrapped`
- Line 265-298: `describe_ecs_tasks_wrapped`  
- Line 477-510: `get_deployment_status_wrapped`

**Goal:** Extract into reusable utility function to eliminate duplication
