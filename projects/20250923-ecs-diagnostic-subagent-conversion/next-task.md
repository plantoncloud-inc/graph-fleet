**Quick Resume**: Drag this file into any chat to continue the project.

## Current Status
- 📍 **Phase**: COMPLETED ✅
- 📅 **Day**: 1 of 2 (Finished early!)
- 🎯 **Next Action**: Test with real ECS services or proceed to remediation sub-agent

## Project Context
Converting the diagnostic process of AWS ECS troubleshooter to use a dedicated sub-agent architecture, following the pattern from context-gathering sub-agent.

## What Was Accomplished ✅
1. Created diagnostic sub-agent instructions with file-based patterns
2. Implemented 3 core diagnostic tool wrappers
3. Integrated with main agent
4. Tested and verified implementation
5. Created comprehensive documentation

- **Context Sub-Agent Reference**: `src/agents/aws_ecs_troubleshooter/docs/context_subagent_architecture.md`

## Project Goals
- Create diagnostic sub-agent with isolated context
- Implement file-based persistence for results
- Enable LLM-driven tool selection
- Keep it SIMPLE - incremental improvements

## Remember
- Simplicity first - don't over-engineer
- Follow the context-gatherer pattern
- Focus on core functionality
- Integration with existing context files is key
