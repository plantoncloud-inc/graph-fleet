# Implementation Summary: ECS Credential Persistence

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Credential Saving (`credential_utils.py`)
✅ **Completed**
- Modified `extract_and_store_credentials` to save actual AWS credentials
- Saves to fixed filename: `aws_credentials.json`
- Keeps sanitized version with timestamp for display purposes
- No session_token handling (as requested)

**Changes made:**
```python
# Save actual credentials for persistence
aws_creds_file = "aws_credentials.json"
actual_creds = {
    "access_key_id": credentials['access_key_id'],
    "secret_access_key": credentials['secret_access_key'],
    "region": credentials['region'],
    "extracted_from": stack_job_file,
    "timestamp": timestamp
}
files[aws_creds_file] = json.dumps(actual_creds, indent=2)
```

### 2. Credential Loading (`diagnostic_wrappers.py`)
✅ **Completed**
- Updated all three diagnostic wrapper functions
- No fallback mechanism - throws error if file missing
- Clear error messages for missing/corrupted files

**Functions updated:**
1. `diagnose_ecs_service_wrapper`
2. Second function (around line 268)
3. `get_deployment_status_wrapped`

**Pattern used:**
```python
# Load credentials from file (no fallback)
files = state.get("files", {})
if "aws_credentials.json" not in files:
    # Return clear error message
else:
    # Parse and use credentials
```

### 3. Remediation Tools
❌ **Skipped** - Will be refactored later to follow the same pattern

## How It Works

1. **During Diagnosis**:
   - User provides ECS service details
   - Context gathering extracts credentials from stack job
   - Credentials saved to `aws_credentials.json` in agent state files

2. **In New Conversation**:
   - User asks for remediation or further diagnosis
   - Tools check for `aws_credentials.json` in state files
   - If found: Load and use credentials
   - If missing: Show clear error asking to run context gathering

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test saving credentials during context gathering
- [ ] Test loading credentials in same conversation
- [ ] Test loading credentials in new conversation
- [ ] Test error when file is missing
- [ ] Test error when file is corrupted

## Next Steps
1. Test the implementation
2. Wait for remediation tools refactoring
3. Then update remediation tools similarly
