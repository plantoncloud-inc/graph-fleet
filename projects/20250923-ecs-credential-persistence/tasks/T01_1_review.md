# Task 01: Review Feedback

**Date**: September 23, 2025  
**Reviewer**: User

## Review Comments

### 1. Remove `load_credentials_from_file` tool
- **Feedback**: "Why do we use the load credentials from file tool? I mean, where are we using it? I don't understand that part."
- **Action**: Remove this tool - credentials should be loaded automatically by the diagnostic/remediation tools

### 2. Use Single Fixed Filename
- **Feedback**: "Let's not keep that credential file name dynamic. We can always have a default file name and use that one only"
- **Rationale**: For this agent, there will only be one AWS credential at a time
- **Action**: Use a fixed filename like `aws_credentials.json` instead of timestamped filenames

### 3. Single Credential File Updates
- **Feedback**: "Even if in the conversation the user expresses a change, then the context will be updated based upon the change only, and that single file will be updated always"
- **Action**: Always overwrite the same file when credentials change

### 4. Remove Session Token
- **Feedback**: "Session token we don't have in our AWS credentials, so let's not include that"
- **Action**: Remove session_token from all credential handling

### 5. Keep It Simple
- **Feedback**: "I don't want too many features to be incorporated here, at least for the initial version"
- **Action**: Simplify the implementation to the bare minimum

## Summary of Requested Changes
1. No separate load tool - direct file reading in diagnostic/remediation tools
2. Fixed filename: `aws_credentials.json`
3. Always overwrite the same file
4. Remove session_token handling
5. Minimize features for initial version
