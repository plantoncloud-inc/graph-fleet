## Additional Review Comments

### Remove Fallback to Credential Context
- **Feedback**: "Let's not have this fallback option if there is any. If there's no `aws_credentials` file, then let's throw an error because this fallback thing is adding more complexity."
- **Rationale**: "I don't want that. Like I said, simpler pattern. The file is not there, then it's not there."
- **Action**: Remove all fallback logic - if `aws_credentials.json` doesn't exist, throw an error

## Summary of Change
- No fallback mechanism
- If file doesn't exist = error
- Simpler, more predictable behavior
- One path only: read from file or fail
