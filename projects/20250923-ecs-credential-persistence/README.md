# ECS Credential Persistence

## Project Overview
**Start Date**: September 23, 2025  
**Timeline**: 2-3 days  
**Type**: Feature Development  
**Tech Stack**: Python, Deep-agents framework

## Description
Implement simple file-based credential persistence for ECS troubleshooting agent to maintain AWS credentials across conversation sessions.

## Primary Goal
Enable AWS credentials to persist between diagnosis and remediation conversations using plain file storage.

## Key Requirements
1. **Simple Implementation**: No encryption, plain text storage for now
2. **File-based Storage**: Use the existing deep-agents file mechanism
3. **Cross-conversation Access**: Credentials saved during diagnosis must be accessible during remediation
4. **No Over-engineering**: Keep it as simple as possible for understanding the system

## Components to Modify
- `credential_utils.py` - Save actual credentials to file
- `diagnostic_wrappers.py` - Read credentials from file
- `credential_context.py` - Update to support file-based persistence
- MCP wrapper tools - Ensure they can access persisted credentials

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Credentials persist in plain text files
- ✅ Can be retrieved in later conversations
- ✅ Simple implementation without encryption
- ✅ Works with existing deep-agents state mechanism

## Constraints
- No encryption required (for simplicity)
- Use existing file-based state mechanism
- Keep implementation straightforward for learning purposes

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)
- Credential encryption
- TTL/expiration handling
- Secure credential management
- Multi-user credential isolation

## Notes
This is an intentionally simple implementation focused on understanding the deep-agents framework. Security features will be added incrementally in future iterations.
