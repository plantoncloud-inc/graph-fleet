# Next Task

**Project**: ECS Credential Persistence  
**Current Phase**: Implementation Complete  
**Next Action**: Test the implementation

## Quick Links
- [Execution Log](./tasks/T01_5_execution.md)
- [Implementation Summary](./implementation-summary.md)
- [Final Plan](./tasks/T01_4_final_plan.md)
- [Project README](./README.md)

## Current Status
✅ Implementation complete for diagnostic tools:
- `credential_utils.py`: Saves actual credentials to `aws_credentials.json`
- `diagnostic_wrappers.py`: All 3 functions updated to read from file
- NO fallback - clear errors if file missing
- Remediation tools skipped (will be refactored later)

## What's Done
1. ✅ Credentials now saved to fixed file during context gathering
2. ✅ Diagnostic tools read from `aws_credentials.json`
3. ✅ Clear error messages when file is missing
4. ❌ Remediation tools NOT updated (by design)
