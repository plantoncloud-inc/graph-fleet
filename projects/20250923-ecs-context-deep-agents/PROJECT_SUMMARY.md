# Project Summary: ECS Context Deep Agents

**Date**: September 23, 2025
**Duration**: ~6 hours (one day project)
**Status**: COMPLETE WITH SUB-AGENT ARCHITECTURE ✅

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented a proper sub-agent architecture for the AWS ECS Troubleshooter. The context-gathering phase now runs as a dedicated sub-agent with isolated context, following deep-agents patterns. The main agent coordinates the workflow by delegating to specialized sub-agents for context gathering, diagnosis, and remediation.

## Objectives Achieved

### ✅ Primary Goals
1. **Sub-agent architecture** - Context gathering runs as isolated sub-agent
2. **LLM-driven tool selection** - Agent decides which tools to call
3. **File-based persistence** - All context saved to timestamped JSON files
4. **TODO management** - Full visibility into agent's planning and progress
5. **Clean separation** - Main agent coordinates, sub-agents specialize

### ✅ Success Criteria Met
- Context gathering uses LLM-driven tool selection ✓
- Implements todo management pattern from deep-agents ✓
- Uses file system for state persistence ✓
- Structured prompts following deep-agents patterns ✓
- Clean integration with MCP tools ✓

## What Was Built

### 1. Sub-Agent Architecture
- **Main Agent**: Coordinator with `get_main_agent_instructions()`
- **Context Sub-Agent**: Dedicated agent for gathering context
- **Diagnostic Sub-Agent**: Existing specialist for analysis
- **Remediation Sub-Agent**: Existing specialist for fixes

### 2. MCP Tool Wrappers (4 tools)
- `list_aws_ecs_services_wrapped` - Lists all services, saves to file
- `get_aws_ecs_service_wrapped` - Gets service config, saves to file
- `get_aws_ecs_service_stack_job_wrapped` - Gets deployment info
- `extract_and_store_credentials` - Extracts AWS credentials

### 3. New Agent Implementation
- `agent_v2.py` - Main agent with sub-agent delegation
- `graph_v2.py` - Graph implementation for v2 agent
- `instructions_v2.py` - Separate instructions for main and context agents

### 4. Documentation
- Sub-agent architecture guide
- Migration guide explaining changes
- Before/after comparison with examples
- Test scripts demonstrating delegation

## Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Sub-Agent Pattern**: Main agent delegates to specialized sub-agents
2. **Context Isolation**: Each sub-agent runs in clean context
3. **Wrapper Pattern**: Following `tavily_search` pattern from deep-agents
4. **Backward Compatible**: v1 and v2 can coexist, easy migration
5. **Phase Separation**: Clear boundaries between context, diagnosis, remediation

## Technical Implementation

### The Core Pattern
```python
@tool
async def mcp_wrapper(
    param: str,
    state: InjectedState,
    tool_call_id: InjectedToolCallId
) -> Command:
    # 1. Call actual MCP tool
    result = await actual_mcp_tool(param)
    
    # 2. Save to timestamped file
    filename = f"prefix_{param}_{timestamp}.json"
    files[filename] = json.dumps(result)
    
    # 3. Return minimal summary
    return Command(
        update={
            "files": files,
            "messages": [ToolMessage(summary, tool_call_id)]
        }
    )
```

## Benefits Realized

1. **Transparency**: Users see exactly what the agent is doing via TODOs
2. **Flexibility**: Agent adapts approach based on situation
3. **Debuggability**: All context saved to inspectable files
4. **Maintainability**: Modular tools easier to update than monolithic functions
5. **User Experience**: Natural conversation flow vs black-box operations

## Lessons Learned

1. **Simplicity Wins**: Initial plan was over-engineered; simpler approach worked better
2. **Patterns Are Powerful**: Following established patterns (tavily_search) accelerated development
3. **State Already There**: ECSTroubleshooterState already extended DeepAgentState
4. **Incremental Works**: Focusing on one phase (context) kept scope manageable

## Future Opportunities

The same pattern can be applied to:
1. **Diagnosis Phase**: Wrap AWS diagnostic tools for file persistence
2. **Remediation Phase**: Add approval workflows with file-based tracking
3. **Cross-Service**: Share context files between different services
4. **Analytics**: Analyze saved files for patterns and insights

## How to Use

### For Developers
```python
# Import the v2 graph
from src.agents.aws_ecs_troubleshooter.graph_v2 import create_graph_v2

# Create and use
workflow = create_graph_v2()
app = workflow.compile()
```

### For Testing
```bash
python src/agents/aws_ecs_troubleshooter/tests/test_v2_agent.py
```

## Project Metrics

- **Files Created**: 12 new files
- **Lines of Code**: ~1,500 lines
- **Tools Wrapped**: 4 MCP tools
- **Documentation**: 3 comprehensive docs
- **Test Coverage**: Unit tests for wrappers + integration test

## Conclusion

The project successfully demonstrated how deep-agents patterns can simplify and improve existing agent implementations. The context-gathering phase is now more transparent, flexible, and maintainable while providing a better user experience.

The implementation serves as a template for applying similar patterns to other phases of the troubleshooter and other agents in the graph-fleet ecosystem.
