# Task Execution: ECS Context Deep Agents

**Execution Start**: 2025-09-23
**Plan Approved**: T01_2_revised_plan.md
**Status**: IN PROGRESS

## Execution Log

### Task 1: Set Up Deep Agent State (COMPLETED)

âœ… Good news! The agent already extends DeepAgentState in `graph.py`:
- ECSTroubleshooterState extends DeepAgentState
- Already has org_id and env_name fields
- File system and todo management already available

No changes needed for Task 1!

### Task 2: Create MCP Tool Wrappers (COMPLETED)

Created the following MCP wrappers following the tavily_search pattern:

1. **planton_wrappers.py**:
   - `get_aws_ecs_service_wrapped` - Gets service config, saves to file
   - `list_aws_ecs_services_wrapped` - Lists all services, saves to file
   - `get_aws_ecs_service_stack_job_wrapped` - Gets deployment info, saves to file

2. **credential_utils.py**:
   - `extract_and_store_credentials` - Extracts AWS creds from saved stack job

3. **test_wrappers.py**:
   - Test script to verify wrapper functionality

4. **instructions_v2.py**:
   - New agent instructions emphasizing LLM-driven tool selection
   - Clear guidance on file-based workflow

Key Pattern Implemented:
- Each wrapper calls the actual MCP tool
- Saves full response to timestamped JSON file
- Returns minimal summary with key info
- Includes helpful "use read_file()" hints

### Task 3: Refactor Agent Logic (COMPLETED)

Created new v2 versions of the agent components:

1. **agent_v2.py**:
   - Uses wrapped MCP tools for context gathering
   - Removed context-specialist sub-agent (main agent handles it)
   - Integrated new instructions emphasizing LLM-driven approach
   - Kept diagnostic and remediation tools as-is

2. **graph_v2.py**:
   - Same state structure (ECSTroubleshooterState)
   - Uses the v2 agent creation function
   - Maintains compatibility with existing workflow

3. **instructions_v2.py**:
   - Clear guidance on file-based workflow
   - Emphasis on TODO management
   - Instructions for LLM-driven tool selection
   - Structured context gathering process

4. **test_v2_agent.py**:
   - Test script to demonstrate the new approach
   - Shows TODO creation and file management
   - Tests both general and specific service scenarios

Key Changes:
- Context gathering is now LLM-driven, not deterministic
- Tools save to files automatically
- Agent works with summaries, reads files for details
- TODO management provides visibility
- No more rigid tool calling sequence

### Task 4: Testing and Documentation (COMPLETED)

Created comprehensive documentation:

1. **deep_agents_migration.md**:
   - Full migration guide from v1 to v2
   - Architecture comparison
   - Benefits and usage examples

2. **comparison_example.md**:
   - Side-by-side before/after comparison
   - Shows exact agent behavior changes
   - Highlights improved user experience

3. **test_v2_agent.py**:
   - Integration test for the new approach
   - Demonstrates TODO creation and file management
   - Shows both general and specific scenarios

4. **PROJECT_SUMMARY.md**:
   - Executive summary of achievements
   - Technical implementation details
   - Lessons learned and future opportunities

## Project Completion

All tasks completed successfully! The context-gathering phase of the AWS ECS Troubleshooter now uses deep-agents patterns with:
- LLM-driven tool selection
- File-based persistence
- TODO management for visibility
- Modular, maintainable architecture

The implementation is backward compatible - v1 and v2 can coexist, allowing gradual migration.
