# Next Task: ECS Troubleshooter Graph V2 Migration

**Project**: 20250923-ecs-troubleshooter-graph-v2-migration  
**Current Phase**: Planning  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-23

## Quick Context

We're migrating the ECS troubleshooter to use the v2 graph implementation exclusively. The old graph.py needs to be archived and graph_v2.py becomes the new graph.py.

## Current Task

Review the initial task plan in `tasks/T01_0_plan.md` and provide feedback before execution.

## Key Files

- **Old Graph**: `/Users/suresh/scm/github.com/plantoncloud-inc/graph-fleet/src/agents/aws_ecs_troubleshooter/graph.py`
- **New Graph**: `/Users/suresh/scm/github.com/plantoncloud-inc/graph-fleet/src/agents/aws_ecs_troubleshooter/graph_v2.py`
- **Config**: `/Users/suresh/scm/github.com/plantoncloud-inc/graph-fleet/langgraph.json`
- **Task Plan**: `/Users/suresh/scm/github.com/plantoncloud-inc/graph-fleet/projects/20250923-ecs-troubleshooter-graph-v2-migration/tasks/T01_0_plan.md`
