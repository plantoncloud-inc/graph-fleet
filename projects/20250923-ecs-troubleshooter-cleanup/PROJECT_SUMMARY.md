# ECS Troubleshooter Cleanup - Project Summary

**Project**: 20250923-ecs-troubleshooter-cleanup  
**Duration**: 1 day  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  

## Objective Achieved

Successfully removed all references to old context_tools and cleaned up deprecated code from the ECS troubleshooter agent after upgrading to the v2 implementation.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Code Cleanup (6/6 tasks completed)
- ✅ Cleaned up agent_v2.py imports
- ✅ Removed context_tools from tools/__init__.py
- ✅ Updated graph.py to use agent_v2
- ✅ Updated test files for v2 compatibility
- ✅ Archived old implementation files
- ✅ Updated documentation

### 2. Files Modified
- `instructions_v2.py` - Added missing constants from old instructions.py
- `agent_v2.py` - Updated to import everything from instructions_v2
- `tools/__init__.py` - Removed gather_planton_context import
- `graph.py` - Updated to import from agent_v2
- `tests/test_troubleshooter.py` - Updated imports and skipped deprecated tests
- `tests/manual_test.py` - Updated imports and references

### 3. Files Archived
Created `archive_v1/` directory containing:
- `agent.py` - Original agent implementation
- `instructions.py` - Original instruction constants
- `context_tools.py` - Original context gathering tool
- `README.md` - Documentation explaining the archive

### 4. Documentation Updates
- Updated main README.md to reflect MCP wrappers
- Added migration complete status to deep_agents_migration.md

## Verification Results

✅ No old imports remain in active code
✅ All references to deprecated modules removed (except in documentation)
✅ No linter errors introduced
✅ Archive preserves old code for reference

## Impact

The codebase is now fully migrated to the v2 implementation with:
- Cleaner imports and dependencies
- No deprecated code in active modules
- Clear separation between old (archived) and new code
- Updated documentation reflecting current state

## Next Steps

1. Run full test suite to ensure nothing broke
2. Deploy and test in LangGraph Studio
3. Monitor for any runtime issues
4. Consider removing archive_v1 after stable period

## Lessons Learned

- Systematic approach with todos helped track progress
- Archiving instead of deleting preserved code history
- Updating tests alongside code changes prevented breaks
- Documentation updates are crucial for maintainability
