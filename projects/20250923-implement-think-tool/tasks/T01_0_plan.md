# Task T01_0: Initial Implementation Plan

**Created**: Tuesday, September 23, 2025  
**Status**: PENDING REVIEW  
**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 days  

## Objective
Create a comprehensive plan for implementing the `think_tool` for the AWS ECS troubleshooter agent, ensuring it follows deep-agents patterns and integrates seamlessly with the existing workflow.

## Background
The `think_tool` is referenced in multiple places in the AWS ECS troubleshooter instructions but is not yet implemented. We have a reference implementation from the deep-agents-from-scratch repository that we can adapt.

## Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Analysis and Understanding (Day 1 Morning)

#### 1.1 Analyze Reference Implementation
- [ ] Study `deep_agents_from_scratch/research_tools.py::think_tool`
- [ ] Understand the reflection structure and parameters
- [ ] Note how it integrates with the research workflow

#### 1.2 Study Existing Patterns
- [ ] Examine existing wrapped tools in `tools/mcp_wrappers/`
- [ ] Understand file-based state management pattern
- [ ] Review how tools are registered in `agent.py`
- [ ] Check graph configuration for tool integration

#### 1.3 Identify Integration Points
- [ ] Map where think_tool is referenced in instructions
- [ ] Identify all agent phases where it should be available
- [ ] Determine file storage strategy for reflections

### Phase 2: Design and Architecture (Day 1 Afternoon)

#### 2.1 Design Tool Implementation
- [ ] Define think_tool parameters and return format
- [ ] Design file storage structure for reflections
- [ ] Plan integration with TODO system
- [ ] Create distinction between TODOs (tasks) and reflections (strategic thinking)

#### 2.2 Create Design Document
- [ ] Document architectural decisions
- [ ] Define interface contract
- [ ] Specify file naming conventions
- [ ] Plan backward compatibility

### Phase 3: Implementation (Day 2)

#### 3.1 Implement Core Tool
- [ ] Create `tools/think_tool.py` or add to existing tools module
- [ ] Implement file-based persistence following wrapped pattern
- [ ] Add timestamp and context tracking
- [ ] Ensure tool returns appropriate summaries

#### 3.2 Integration
- [ ] Register tool in `agent.py`
- [ ] Add to appropriate tool lists for each phase
- [ ] Update graph configuration if needed
- [ ] Ensure tool is accessible to sub-agents

#### 3.3 Testing
- [ ] Create unit tests for think_tool
- [ ] Test integration with context gathering workflow
- [ ] Verify file persistence and retrieval
- [ ] Test with existing manual test scenarios

### Phase 4: Documentation and Polish (Day 3)

#### 4.1 Update Documentation
- [ ] Update README with think_tool usage
- [ ] Add examples to instructions
- [ ] Document best practices for reflection
- [ ] Create usage guidelines

#### 4.2 Final Testing
- [ ] End-to-end workflow testing
- [ ] Verify all referenced locations work
- [ ] Test with real troubleshooting scenarios
- [ ] Gather feedback and iterate

## Implementation Details

### Tool Structure (Proposed)
```python
def think_tool(reflection: str, context: Optional[str] = None) -> str:
    """Tool for strategic reflection on troubleshooting progress.
    
    Args:
        reflection: Detailed reflection on progress, findings, gaps, next steps
        context: Optional context identifier (e.g., "context_gathering", "diagnosis")
    
    Returns:
        Confirmation message with file location
    """
```

### File Storage Pattern
```
/tmp/ecs_troubleshooter/reflections/
├── 20250923_140000_context_gathering.json
├── 20250923_141500_diagnosis.json
└── 20250923_143000_remediation.json
```

### Integration Points
1. **Context Gathering**: After collecting service info
2. **Diagnosis**: After analyzing issues
3. **Remediation**: Before and after applying fixes
4. **Main Agent**: Strategic planning between phases

## Success Metrics
1. Tool successfully saves reflections to timestamped files
2. Tool integrates with all three agent phases
3. Reflections provide value beyond TODO tracking
4. No disruption to existing workflow
5. Clear documentation and examples

## Risk Mitigation
1. **Over-engineering**: Keep it simple, follow existing patterns
2. **File proliferation**: Implement cleanup strategy for old reflections
3. **Performance impact**: Ensure async file operations where possible
4. **User confusion**: Clear distinction from TODOs in documentation

## Dependencies
- Reference: `deep_agents_from_scratch/research_tools.py`
- Pattern: Existing wrapped tools in `tools/mcp_wrappers/`
- Integration: `agent.py` and graph configuration

## Next Steps After Approval
1. Begin with Phase 1.1 - Analyze reference implementation
2. Create design decision document
3. Implement minimal viable version
4. Iterate based on testing
