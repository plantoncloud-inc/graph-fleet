# Project: Implement Think Tool

## Overview
**Project Name**: implement-think-tool  
**Created**: Tuesday, September 23, 2025  
**Timeline**: 2-3 days  
**Type**: feature-development  

## Description
Implement the think_tool for AWS ECS troubleshooter agent to enable structured reflection and strategic planning during troubleshooting workflows.

## Primary Goal
Implement the `think_tool` that's referenced in the instructions but currently missing, allowing the agent to reflect on progress and plan next steps.

## Technology Stack
- **Language**: Python
- **Framework**: Deep-agents patterns (from deep-agents-from-scratch)
- **Integration**: AWS ECS Troubleshooter agent in graph-fleet

## Affected Components
- `src/agents/aws_ecs_troubleshooter/tools/` - New tool implementation
- `src/agents/aws_ecs_troubleshooter/agent.py` - Tool registration
- Graph configuration files
- Instructions and prompts

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Think_tool properly integrated into AWS ECS troubleshooter
- [ ] Follows deep-agents pattern for file-based state management
- [ ] Enables reflection on gathered context, diagnosis results, and planning
- [ ] Works seamlessly with existing TODO system
- [ ] Tool is registered and accessible in all agent phases
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect new capability

## Dependencies & Constraints
- Must follow deep-agents pattern from reference implementation
- Should integrate smoothly with existing tool workflow
- Must maintain consistency with other wrapped tools in the system
- Reference implementation: `/Users/suresh/scm/github.com/langchain-ai/deep-agents-from-scratch/src/deep_agents_from_scratch/research_tools.py`

## Risks & Mitigation
1. **Integration complexity**: Ensure compatibility with existing tool workflow
   - Mitigation: Study existing wrapped tools pattern first
2. **Redundancy with TODOs**: Tool might overlap with TODO functionality
   - Mitigation: Clear distinction - TODOs for tasks, think_tool for strategic reflection
3. **Pattern consistency**: Must match deep-agents patterns
   - Mitigation: Follow reference implementation closely
